TODO before the next release:

Calculate altimeter pressure to send off to CWOP. 
See http://davisnet.com/product_documents/weather/app_notes/AN_28-derived-weather-variables.pdf
In particular, see Paul G's note about softWx.

Remove version in weewx.conf

Make sure setup.py removes option stats_types.

Remove reference to stats_types in the docs.

Reconsider the name unit_label_dict in genplot.py
