TODO before the next release:

Because the location of the executables and the configuration files now depend
on the installation strategy, they all need symbolic names in the documentation.

The following changes need to be incorporated into the packaging machinery:

    runreports.py -> wee-reports.py
    config_database.py -> wee-config-database.py
    config_vp.py -> wee-config-vantage.py
    config_fousb.py -> wee-config-fousb.py

Consider changing:
    VantagePro.py -> vantage.py
    WMR918.py -> wmr9x8.py
