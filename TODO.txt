TODO before the next release:

resolve the updating of the forecast module.  putting forecast.py in the user
directory means that it does not get updated by setup.py, but it does get
updated by rpm and deb.  either move it into bin/weewx or modify setup.py
to explicitly update forecast.py

Sign the rpm and deb packages?

Add section to userguide about how to eliminate dots by changing station
archive interval.  Useful for fine offset and ws23xx stations since they
default to 30 and 60 minute intervals, respectively.

Include the following uploaders in 2.6?:
 - emoncms (emoncms.org)
 - seg (smart energy groups)
 - pachube (aka cosm, aka xively)
 - weatherbug
 - openweathermap
 - wetter.com
 - awekas
They are available via the wiki for 2.5 and earlier, but the changes to REST
will break those.  So support will be easier if we include the new versions
with 2.6.

Figure out why the heartbeat doesn't work on the WMR200.
