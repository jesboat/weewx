TODO before the next release:

Add the other services (QC, Calibrations, Reporting, etc.).

Add an ability to do the archive records in software (rather than downloading
off the logger).

Port to another (any!) WX station hardware.

Update the "Customizing guide" reflecting the new engine architecture.

Get rid of cache LOOP data.

Change how to configure the VP. Maybe separate config programs?  Maybe specify options 
on the command line then take them out of weewx.conf
