TODO before the next release:

Make sure the unit type can change between LOOP records. NB: rain uses US units, everything else
metric.

Allow archives to store data in metric units

Change calibration service so it can take any units (not just the native hardware units)

Put clock drift stuff in its own section in weewx.conf.

Remove clock drift logic from class VantagePro. It should just get the time or set the time.

Consider changing the name of VantagePro.py to VantageSeries.py or something similar.

Add info about bad USB to serial converters to the "Troubleshooting" section. In particular,
how to use minicom to send a "TEST" command to the VP2.

Calculate altimeter pressure to send off to CWOP. 
See http://davisnet.com/product_documents/weather/app_notes/AN_28-derived-weather-variables.pdf

When using UTF8 characters in a template file, either find a way to automatically 
include the Cheetah directive
  #encoding UTF-8
automatically, or put in the customizing manual that the user must include it.=======
Add an ability to do the archive records in software (rather than downloading
off the logger).

Update the "Customizing guide" reflecting the new engine architecture.

Update the "User's Guide" to update the new config utilities.

Abstract the database type a little more (in preparation for supporting MySQL).

An archive object probably should not be shared between the main thread and the RESTful thread.
