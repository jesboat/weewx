TODO before the next release:

the ws1090 will sometimes fail with 'station is not logging data' when doing
catchup on startup, even though wee_config_fousb indicates that the console
is, in fact, logging data.  need to either add retries for get_records or
rework easterbrook's live_data code.

possibly implement averaging rainRate calculation instead of the
current near-instantaneous implementation in fousb
