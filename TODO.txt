TODO before the next release:

Move heating and cooling degree days base into templates, with default.

Make sure the template tags $unit.label.outTemp, etc. still work.

Upgrade notes: the calling signature of TaggedStats has changed.

Check that heating and cooling degree calculations are correct.

Test adding a new sql type ("pipepressure")

Test adding a new unit group ("group_pipepressure"? "psi" and "kPa")

Test adding a new archive query (number of nulls?)

Test adding a new stats query

Change setup.py to reflect new modules.

Have setup.py preserve the user package when upgrading.
