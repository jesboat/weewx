TODO before the next release:

possibly implement averaging rainRate calculation instead of the
current near-instantaneous implementation in fousb

Is the WH3081 downloading the right radiation units? See Elton Prytz's post
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/weewx-user/Dmt555dnWns/discussion

display the version number from bin/__init__.py rather than whatever is in
weewx.conf.  the weewx.conf version number cannot be trusted and should be
used for updates to indicate the version number of the configuration file,
not for reporting the application version.
