TODO before the next release:

Add an ability to do the archive records in software (rather than downloading
off the logger).

Port to another (any!) WX station hardware.

Update the "Customizing guide" reflecting the new engine architecture.

Update the "User's Guide" to update the new config utilities.

Get rid of cache LOOP data.

Abstract the database type a little more (in preparation for supporting MySQL).
