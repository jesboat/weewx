TODO before the next release:

Search for memory leaks. After 125d of uptime, weewx has grown to use 255MB memory.
Here's a good article on how to do this: http://www.lshift.net/blog/2008/11/14/tracing-python-memory-leaks
Alternative: use heapy http://pypi.python.org/pypi/guppy

Clarify the install instructions for the case where pysqlite comes with Python.

Can we unify how the set of statstypes is set with how the set of archive types are set?

Test adding a new archive query (number of nulls?)

Test adding a new stats query
