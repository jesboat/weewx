TODO before the next release:

Missing keys in records generated from LOOP data. Check 'em out. 
	set(['lowOutTemp', 'highUV', 'highRadiation', 'rain', 'rxCheckPercent', 'ET', 'highOutTemp'])

Dynamically obtain the hardware configuration for index.html

Consider changing the name of VantagePro.py to VantageSeries.py or something similar.

Add info about bad USB to serial converters to the "Troubleshooting" section. In particular,
how to use minicom to send a "TEST" command to the VP2.

Calculate altimeter pressure to send off to CWOP.

  #encoding UTF-8

Add an ability to do the archive records in software (rather than downloading

Update the "Customizing guide" reflecting the new engine architecture.

Update the "User's Guide" to update the new config utilities.

Abstract the database type a little more (in preparation for supporting MySQL).

An archive object probably should not be shared between the main thread and the RESTful thread.
