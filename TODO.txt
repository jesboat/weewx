TODO before the next release:

Include the following uploaders in 2.6:
 - emoncms (emoncms.org)
 - seg (smart energy groups)
 - pachube (aka cosm, aka xively)
They are available via the wiki for 2.5 and earlier, but the changes to REST
will break those.  So support will be easier if we include the new versions
with 2.6.

Figure out why the heartbeat doesn't work on the WMR200.
