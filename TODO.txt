TODO before the next release:

figure out how to prevent setup.py from scrambling comments in weewx.conf

extension installer/uninstaller:
  need to prune from weewx.conf on uninstall: skin, service
  delete .pyc files on uninstall
  do not overwrite fields in weewx.conf if they already exist
  decide where to put extension sources in rpm package/installation
  decide where to put extension sources in deb package/installation
  make wee_setup a symlink to setup.py on deb and rpm
  restart weewx after extension is installed?

Figure out why the heartbeat doesn't work on the WMR200.
