TODO before the next release:

Figure out some way that the tag $current.foo.has_data would work.

Check that heating and cooling degree calculations are correct.

Test adding a new sql type ("pipepressure")

Test adding a new unit group ("group_pipepressure"? "psi" and "kPa")

Test adding a new archive query (number of nulls?)

Test adding a new stats query

Change setup.py to reflect new modules.

Have setup.py preserve the user package when upgrading.
