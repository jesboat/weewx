TODO before the next release:

Install wview and set it up to use metric units in the database. See what unit types it chooses.

Make sure the VP altitude matches the station altitude.

Missing keys in records generated from LOOP data. Check 'em out. 
	set(['lowOutTemp', 'highUV', 'highRadiation', 'rain', 'rxCheckPercent', 'ET', 'highOutTemp'])
The type 'rain' is the one that's worrisome: there's no way to get it from LOOP data!

Consider changing the name of VantagePro.py to VantageSeries.py or something similar.

Add info about bad USB to serial converters to the "Troubleshooting" section. In particular,
how to use minicom to send a "TEST" command to the VP2.

Calculate altimeter pressure to send off to CWOP. 
See http://davisnet.com/product_documents/weather/app_notes/AN_28-derived-weather-variables.pdf

Guard against running a report with nothing in the database. In particular, initializing
the almanac.

When using UTF8 characters in a template file, either find a way to automatically 
include the Cheetah directive
  #encoding UTF-8
automatically, or put in the customizing manual that the user must include it.=======
Add an ability to do the archive records in software (rather than downloading
off the logger).

Update the "Customizing guide" reflecting the new engine architecture.

Update the "User's Guide" to update the new config utilities.

Abstract the database type a little more (in preparation for supporting MySQL).
