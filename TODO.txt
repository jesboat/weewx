TODO before the next release:

Every file seems to be getting regenerated instead of just stale ones.

setup.py should deal with station_url in weewx.conf

Can wind chill be retrieved from the hardware for the WMR918
(as well as WMR9x8)?

Document the station registry facility.

Figure out why the heartbeat doesn't work on the WMR200.
