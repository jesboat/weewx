TODO before the next release:

verify gpg signatures on rpm packages using redhat/suse tools

extension installer/uninstaller:
  need to prune from weewx.conf on uninstall: skin, service
  delete .pyc files on uninstall
  do not overwrite fields in weewx.conf if they already exist

Figure out why the heartbeat doesn't work on the WMR200.
