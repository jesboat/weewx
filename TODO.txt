TODO before the next release:

Docs should be updated to reflect the change from FileGenerator to CheetahGenerator.
This includes:
  o Change in section name from [FileGenerator] to [CheetahGenerator]
  o How to write new-style search list extensions
  
Clean up all the _getSearchList() functions in cheetahgenerator.py. Do we really
need them all?

Every file seems to be getting regenerated instead of just stale ones.

setup.py should deal with webpath in weewx.conf

Can wind chill be retrieved from the hardware for the WMR918
(as well as WMR9x8)?
