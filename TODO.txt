TODO before the next release:

Can we unify how the set of statstypes is set with how the set of archive types are set?

Test adding a new sql type ("pipepressure")

Test adding a new unit group ("group_pipepressure"? "psi" and "kPa")

Test adding a new archive query (number of nulls?)

Test adding a new stats query
