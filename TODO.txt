TODO before the next release:

Add the skin subdirectory to PYTHONPATH automatically, 
to allow custom skins to find their generators.

Clarify table of what can be used where. Such as windvec.

$unit_type no longer offered in templates

time strftime formats moved to under Units in skin.conf

base temperature for heating and cooling degree days moved to skin.conf

altitude configuration now takes an explicit unit type.
So does base cooldeg and heatdeg
