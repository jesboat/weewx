TODO before the next release:

Calculate altimeter pressure to send off to CWOP. 
See http://davisnet.com/product_documents/weather/app_notes/AN_28-derived-weather-variables.pdf

The WS2080 port from Matthew Wall needs documentation / install instructions.

Check for dewpoint underflow bit. See William Page's post.
