Allow stats of highest minimum and lowest maximum over a time period.

possibly implement averaging rainRate calculation instead of the
current near-instantaneous implementation in fousb

Offer tags to support JSON. In particular, vectors.

Make record generation from the accumulators into a separate service, allowing 
easier customization. This would also make calculation of extensive quantities
easier.

The Davis console could intercept new archive record events and add rxcheckpercent
and rain to software generated records.

databases and, instead, offer up the last record when the reporting thread
starts.

New observation types would have their unit group attached as a suffix.
E.g., _energy.

Move to a "plugin" architecture.

Support the WU "RapidFire" protocol.

statistics.

Use the tagged stats classes for the archive database as well, thus unifying
the two databases.

Offer "cumulative" as an aggregation type.

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.

More dynamic access to the database. Check out
Werkzeug. http://werkzeug.pocoo.org

Dynamic web updates, using AJAX.

Port to Windows.

Allow variable y-axis labelling. Right now it's hardwired to every other major
