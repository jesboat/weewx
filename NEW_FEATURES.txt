                    Possible NEW FEATURES

Allow the console to participate as yet another service. Then, the Davis console
could intercept new archive record events and add rxcheckpercent and rain to
software generated records.

Put the stats types in a metafile, rather than using the list of tables.

Specify "max time gap" for the graphs. For gaps bigger than this, there would be
no connecting plot line.

Add ordinate wind descriptions "N, NE, E,", etc.

Use the tagged stats classes for the archive database as well, thus unifying the
two databases.

Break out the weather specific logic in weewx.stats as a separate, O-R class.

Offer "cumulative" as an aggregation type.

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

Debian packaging.

ET appears only at the top of the hour in an archive record. So, it's effective
archive interval is 60 minutes. Does this carry through?

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.

More dynamic access to the database. Check out

Dynamic web updates, using AJAX.
