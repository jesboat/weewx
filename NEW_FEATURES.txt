                    Possible NEW FEATURES

Allow the console to participate as yet another service. Then, the Davis console
could intercept new archive record events and add rxcheckpercent and rain to software
generated records.

Add ordinate wind descriptions "N, NE, E,", etc. Same with barometer
trends.

Port to WMR968? Or La Crosse WS2355?

Offer "cumulative" as an aggregation type.

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

Support for APT package.

ET appears only at the top of the hour in an archive record. So,
it's effective archive interval is 60 minutes. Does this carry through?

Can we unify how the set of statstypes is set with how the set of archive types are set?

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.
