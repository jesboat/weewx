                    Possible NEW FEATURES

Offer tags to support JSON. In particular, vectors.

Calculate altimeter pressure to send off to CWOP. 
See http://davisnet.com/product_documents/weather/app_notes/AN_28-derived-weather-variables.pdf
In particular, see Paul G's note about softWx.

Make record generation from the accumulators into a separate service, allowing 
easier customization. This would also make calculation of extensive quantities easier.

Allow the console to participate as yet another service. Then, the Davis console
could intercept new archive record events and add rxcheckpercent and rain to
software generated records.

Consider breaking the rule that reporting can only be done through the databases and,
instead, offer up the last record when the reporting thread starts.

New observation types would have their unit group attached as a suffix. E.g., _energy.

Move to a "plugin" architecture.

Support the WU "RapidFire" protocol.

Use the tagged stats classes for the archive database as well, thus unifying the
two databases.

Offer "cumulative" as an aggregation type.

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

ET appears only at the top of the hour in an archive record. So, it's effective
archive interval is 60 minutes. Does this carry through?

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.

More dynamic access to the database. Check out
Werkzeug. http://werkzeug.pocoo.org

Dynamic web updates, using AJAX.

Port to Windows.
