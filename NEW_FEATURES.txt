                    Possible NEW FEATURES

Eliminate the need for Ftp/skin.conf and Rsync/skin.conf.  More generally,
do not require a skin.conf file for each report.  In the case of Ftp and Rsync
one can simply put the generator_list in weewx.conf as part of the report
definition.  A report with no skin.conf should run with sane defaults.
Templates should also be "drop in." If they appear in the directory, they
get used.
                    
The weewx service would support dependencies or, at least, be grouped into
like services. This would make it easier to install new services by
3rd parties.

RESTful services should become 1st class weewx services. This would make it
easy to implement something like the Rapidfire protocol.

Fixes to REST base class:
 - eliminate requirement that derived must define site (or make it ctor arg)
 - eliminate requirement that derived must have station member
 - make extractRecordFrom extensible (allow override of archive_types and
     possibly sql_select)

Offer tags to support JSON. In particular, vectors. A tag like
$day.outTemp.vector would offer a vector of temperatures for the day.
Aggregation would be nice.

Allow statistics to be extracted from the archive database, as well as the
stats database. This would allow hourly statistics. Taken to the extreme, it
could also allow the elimination of the stats database if the performance is
acceptable.

Allow new derived types to be created by the user. Right now, things like
heating and cooling degree days are hardwired in, but it ought to be possible
to add things like that modularly. 

The Davis console could intercept new archive record events and add
rxcheckpercent and rain to software generated records.

Consider breaking the rule that reporting can only be done through the 
databases and, instead, offer up the last record when the reporting thread
starts.

A QC "Spike" detector.  Possible options include:

option 1: maximum delta relative to previous value.  if the difference between
candidate value x1 and previous value x0 is greater than d, reject the
candidate value and use None instead.  if there are no previous points
(e.g. at first sensor sampling during initial startup), then the delta
qc is not applied.  the configuration would look something like this:

[StdQC]
    ...
    [[Delta]]
        outTemp = 10 # temperature change over 10 F will be replaced with None
        pressure = 0.2 # pressure change over 0.2 inHg will be replaced with None

option 2: maximum percentage change over previous N values.  if the delta
between the candidate value and the average of the N previous samples is
greater than some value (measured as a percentage), reject the candidate
value and use None instead.

[StdQC]
    ...
    [[PercentChange]]
        number_of_samples = 3 # use 3 samples for calculations
        outTemp = 2 # change greater than 2% will be replaced by None
        pressure = 1 # pressure change greater than 1% will be replaced by None

Option 3: max outlier delta. The idea here is that a jump in value is allowed
  (maybe a front went through?), but not a jump up, then down.

[StdQC]
  [[MaxOutlier]]
    outTemp = 0.5
    barometer = 0.2

Harden up the MySQL database connection.

Allow reporting services to be fired off at something other than every
archive period. In particular, FTP.

possibly implement averaging rainRate calculation instead of the
current near-instantaneous implementation in fousb

New observation types would have their unit group attached as a suffix.
E.g., _energy.

Offer a more "weather friendly" Metric unit system.

Support the WU "RapidFire" protocol.

Offer "cumulative" as an aggregation type.

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

Current ET for the VP2 should show the value it emitted at the top of the hour.

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.

More dynamic access to the database. Check out
Werkzeug. http://werkzeug.pocoo.org

Dynamic web updates, using AJAX, or Meteor.

Port to Windows.

Allow variable y-axis labelling. Right now it's hardwired to every other major
tick mark.

Make units extensible.
