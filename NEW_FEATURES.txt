NEW FEATURES to be added in decreasing order of importance.

Support other weather station hardware (will probably require a rewrite of wxengine)

Offer "cumulative" as an aggregation type.

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

Support for APT package.

it's effective archive interval is 60 minutes. Does this carry through?

Add support for MySQL.

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.
