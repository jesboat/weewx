                    Possible NEW FEATURES
                    
Move to a "plugin" architecture. Services would be discovered at runtime
(instead of listed in service_list). Where do configuration files go? Model it
like Apache?

Same with file generators. They should be discovered at runtime. Graceful
fallback if the necessary software is not installed. Regeneration happens in
selectable time periods.

Offer tags to support JSON. In particular, vectors. A tag like
$day.outTemp.vector would offer a vector of temperatures for the day.
Aggregation would be nice.

Allow statistics to be extracted from the archive database, as well as the
stats database. This would allow hourly statistics. Taken to the extreme, it
could also allow the elimination of the stats database if the performance is
acceptable.

Allow new derived types to be created by the user. Right now, things like
heating and cooling degree days are hardwired in, but it ought to be possible
to add things like that modularly. 

The Davis console could intercept new archive record events and add
rxcheckpercent and rain to software generated records.

Consider breaking the rule that reporting can only be done through the 
databases and, instead, offer up the last record when the reporting thread
starts.

possibly implement averaging rainRate calculation instead of the
current near-instantaneous implementation in fousb

New observation types would have their unit group attached as a suffix.
E.g., _energy.

Offer a more "weather friendly" Metric unit system.

Support the WU "RapidFire" protocol.

Offer "cumulative" as an aggregation type.

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

Current ET for the VP2 should show the value it emitted at the top of the hour.

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.

More dynamic access to the database. Check out
Werkzeug. http://werkzeug.pocoo.org

Dynamic web updates, using AJAX.

Port to Windows.

Allow variable y-axis labelling. Right now it's hardwired to every other major
tick mark.
