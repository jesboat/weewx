                    Possible NEW FEATURES

Allow the console to participate as yet another service. Then, the Davis console
could intercept new archive record events and add rxcheckpercent and rain to
software generated records.

Add ordinate wind descriptions "N, NE, E,", etc.

Use the tagged stats classes for the archive database as well, thus unifying the
two databases.

Offer "cumulative" as an aggregation type.

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

Debian packaging.

ET appears only at the top of the hour in an archive record. So, it's effective
archive interval is 60 minutes. Does this carry through?

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.
