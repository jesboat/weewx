CHANGE HISTORY
--------------------------------

For complete documentation, see http://www.weewx.com/docs


2.0.0 XX/YY/12

Changed  the  engine architecture  so  it  is more  event  driven.  It now  uses
callbacks, making it easier to add new event types.

Added utility config_vp, for configuring the VantagePro hardware.

Added utility config_database, for configuring the databases.

Both utilities use argparse (instead of optparse), which is included with Python
2.7. For earlier versions of Python,  it will have to be supplied.  Installation
is  trivial:  just  download from  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse  and put 
argparse.py in any sys.path directory.

When doing DMPAFT, no longer tries to correct for DST.


1.13.X 06/14/12

Changed umask in daemon.py to 0022. Thanks, Charlie!


1.13.2 05/02/12

Now allows CWOP stations with prefix 'EW'.

Fixed bug that showed itself in the line color with plots with 3 or more lines.

Changed debug message when reaching the end  of memory in the  VP2 to something 
slightly less alarming.

1.13.1 03/25/12

Added  finer control  over the  line plots.  Can now  add optional  markers. The
marker_type  can be  'none' (the  default),  'cross', 'box',  'circle', or  'x'.
Also, line_type can  now either be 'solid' (the default)  or 'none' (for scatter
plots). Same day I'll add 'dashed', but not now. :-)

Conditionally imports sqlite3. If it does not support the "with" statement, then
imports pysqlite2 as sqlite3.


1.13.0 03/13/12

The binding to the SQL database to be used now happens  much later  when running
reports. This  allows more than one database  to be used when  running a report.
Extra databases can be specified in the  option list for a report. I use this to
display  broadband bandwidth  information,  which was  collected  by a  separate
program.  Email me  for details  on  how to  do this.  Introducing this  feature
changed the signature of a few functions. See the upgrade guide for details.


1.12.4 02/13/12

User Alf Høgemark found an error in the encoding of solar data for CWOP and sent
me a fix. Thanks, Alf!

Now always  uses "import  sqlite3", resulting in  using the version  of pysqlite
that  comes  with  Python.  This   means  the  install  instructions  have  been
simplified.

Now doesn't  choke when using  the (rare) Python  version of NameMapper  used by
Cheetah.


1.12.3 02/09/12

Added  start script  for FreeBSD,  courtesy of  user Fabian  Abplanalp.  Thanks,
Fabian!

Added the ability to respond to a "status" query to the Debian startup script.

RESTful posts can now recover from more HTTP errors.

Station serial port can now recover from a SerialException error (usually caused
when there is a process competing for the serial port).

Continue to fiddle with the retry logic when reading LOOP data.


1.12.2 01/18/12

Added check for FTP error code '521'  to the list of possibilities if a directory
already exists. Thanks to user Clyde!

More complete information when unable to load a module file. Thanks, Jason!

Added a  few new  unit types  to the list  of possible  target units  when using
explicit conversion. Thanks, Antonio!

Discovered and fixed problem caused by  the Davis docs giving the wrong "resend"
code (should be decimal 21, not hex 21).

Improved robustness of VantagePro configuration utility.

Fixed problem where an exception gets thrown when changing VP archive interval.

Simplified some of the logic in the VP2 driver.

 
1.12.1 11/03/11

Now corrects  for rain bucket  size if it  is something other than  the standard
0.01 inch bucket.


1.12.0 10/29/11

Added  the  ability  to change  bucket  type,  rain  year start,  and  barometer
calibration data  in the console  using the utility configure.py.   Added option
"--info",  which  queries  the  console  and returns  information  about  EEPROM
settings.  Changed  configure.py so it can  do hardware-specific configurations,
in anticipation of supporting hardware besides the Davis series.

Reorganized the documentation.


1.11.0 10/06/11

Added support for the Davis WeatherLinkIP. Thanks, Peter Nock and Travis Pickle!

Added support for older Rev A type archive records.

Added  patch from  user  Dan Haller  that sends  UV  and radiation  data to  the
WeatherUnderground if available. Thanks, Dan!

Added  patch from  user Marijn  Vriens that  allows fallback  to the  version of
pysqlite that comes with many versions of Python. Thanks, Marijn!

Now does garbage  collection after an archive record is  obtained and before the
main loop is restarted.


1.10.2 04/14/11

Added RA and declination for the Sun  and Moon to the Daily Almanac. Equinox and
solstice are now displayed in chronological order. Same with new and full moons.

Examples  alarm.py and  lowBattery.py now  include more  error checks,  allow an
optional 'subject' line  to the sent email, and allow a  comma separated list of
recipients.


1.10.1 03/30/11

Substitutes US Units  if a user does not specify  anything (instead of exception
KeyError).

Almanac uses default temperature and pressure if they are 'None'.

Prettied  up web  page  almanac data  in the  case  where pyephem  has not  been
installed.

Fixed up malformed CSS script weewx.css.


1.10.0 03/29/11

Added extensive almanac  information if the optional package  'pyephem' has been
installed

Added a weewx "favorite icon" favicon.ico that displays in your browser toolbar.

Added  a mobile  formatted HTML  page, courtesy  of user  Vince  Skahan (thanks,
Vince!!).

Tags can now  be ended with a unit  type to convert to a new  unit. For example,
say your pressure group ("group_pressure") has been set to show inHg. The normal
tag   notation  of   "$day.barometer.avg"  will   show  something   like  "30.05
inHg". However, the tag "$day.barometer.avg.mbar" will show "1017.5 mbar".

Added special tag  "exists" to test whether an  observation type exists. Example
"$year.foo.exists"  will  return  False  if  there  is  no  type  "foo"  in  the
statistical database.

Added special tag "has_data" to test  whether an observation type exists and has
a  non-zero number of  data points  over the  aggregation period.   For example,
"$year.soilMoist1.has_data" will return "True"  if soilMoist1 both exists in the
stats database and contains some data (meaning, you have the hardware).

Y-axis  plot  labels  (such  as  "°F")   can  now  be  overridden  in  the  plot
configuration section of skin.conf by using option "y_label".

Added executable module "runreports.py" for running report generation only.

Added package "user",  which can contain any user  extensions. This package will
not get overridden in the upgrade process.

Added  the ability  to reconfigure  the main  database, i.e.,  add or  drop data
types.   Along  the   same  line,  statistical  types  can   also  be  added  or
dropped. Email me for details on how to do this.

Now makes all of the LOOP  and archive data available to services. This includes
new keys:

  LOOP data: 
    'extraAlarm1'    'extraAlarm2'    'extraAlarm3'    'extraAlarm4'
    'extraAlarm5'    'extraAlarm6'    'extraAlarm7'    'extraAlarm8'
    'forecastIcon'   'forecastRule'
    'insideAlarm'    'outsideAlarm1'  'outsideAlarm2'  'rainAlarm'
    'soilLeafAlarm1' 'soilLeafAlarm2' 'soilLeafAlarm3' 'soilLeafAlarm4'
    'sunrise'        'sunset'

  Archive data:
    'forecastRule'   'highOutTemp'    'highRadiation'   'highUV'
    'lowOutTemp'

Started a more formal test suite. There are now tests for the report generators.
These are  not included in  the normal distribution,  but can be  retrieved from
SourceForge via svn.


1.9.3 02/04/11

Now correctly decodes temperatures from LOOP packets as signed shorts (rather
than unsigned).

Now does a CRC check on LOOP data.

Changed VantagePro.accumulateLoop to make it slightly more robust.


1.9.2 11/20/10

Now catches  exception of type OverflowError when  calculating celsius dewpoint.
(Despite the  documentation indicating otherwise, math.log() can  still throw an
OverflowError)

Fixed  bug that  causes  crash in  VantagePro.accumulateLoop()  during fall  DST
transition in certain situations.

VP2 does  not store records during  the one hour fall  DST transition.  Improved
logic in dealing with this.

Changed install so that it backs  up the ./bin subdirectory, then overwrites the
old one. Also,  does not install the ./skins subdirectory at  all if one already
exists (thus preserving any user customization).


1.9.1 9/9/10

Now catches exceptions of type httplib.BadStatusLine when doing RESTful posts.

Added an  extra decimal point of precision  to dew point reports  to the Weather
Underground and PWS.


1.9.0 7/04/10

Added a new service, StdQC, that offers a rudimentary data check.

Corrected error in rain year total if rain year does not start in January.

Moved option max_drift (the max amount of clock drift to tolerate) to section
[Station].

Added check for a bad storm start time.

Added checks for bad dateTime.

Simplified VantagePro module.


1.8.4 6/06/10

Fixed problem that shows itself if weewx starts up at precisely the beginning of
an archive interval. Symptom is max recursion depth exceeded.

Units for UV in LOOP records corrected. Also, introduced new group for UV,
group_uv_index. Thanks to user A. Burriel for this fix!


1.8.3 5/20/10

Problem with configuring archive interval found and fixed by user A. Burriel
(thanks, Antonio!)


1.8.2 5/9/10

Added check to skip calibration for a type that doesn't exist in LOOP or archive
records. This allows windSpeed and windGust to be calibrated separately.


1.8.1 5/1/10

Ported to Cheetah V2.4.X


1.8.0 04/28/10

Added CWOP support.

Storage of LOOP and archive data into the SQL databases is now just another
service, StdArchive.

Added a calibration service, StdCalibrate, that can correct LOOP and archive
data.

Average console battery voltage is now calculated from LOOP data, and saved to
the archive as 'consBatteryVoltage'.

Transmitter battery status is now ORd together from LOOP data, and saved to the
archive as 'txBatteryStatus'.

Added stack tracebacks for unrecoverable exceptions.

Added a wrapper to the serial port in the VantagePro code. When used in a Python
"with" statement, it automatically releases the serial port if an exception
happens, allowing a more orderly shutdown.

Offered some hints in the documentation on how to automount your VP2 when using
a USB connection.

Corrected error in units. getTargetType() that showed itself with when the
console memory was freshly cleared, then tried to graph something immediately.


1.7.0 04/15/10

Big update.

Reports now use skins for their "look or feel."  Options specific to the
presentation layer have been moved out of the weewx configuration file
'weewx.conf' to a skin configuration file, 'skin.conf'. Other options have
remained behind.

Because the configuration file weewx.conf was split, the installation script
setup.py will NOT merge your old configuration file into the new one. You will
have to reedit weewx.conf to put in your customizations.

FTP is treated as just another report, albeit with an unusual generator. You can
have multiple FTP sessions, each to a different server, or uploading to or from
a different area.

Rewrote the FTP upload package so that it allows more than one FTP session to be
active in the same local directory. This version also does fewer hits on the
server, so it is significantly faster.

The configuration files weewx.conf and skin.conf now expect UTF-8 characters
throughout.

The encoding for reports generated from templates can be chosen. By default, the
day, week, month, and year HTML files are encoded using HTML entities; the NOAA
reports encoded using 'strict ascii.' Optionally, reports can be encoded using
UTF-8.

Revamped the template formatting. No longer use class ModelView. Went to a
simpler system built around classes ValueHelper and UnitInfo.

Optional formatting was added to all tags in the templates. There are now
optional endings:
  'string': Use specified string for None value.
  'formatted': No label.
  'format': Format using specified string format.
  'nolabel': Format using specified string format; no label.
  'raw': return the underlying data with no string formatting or label.

For the index, week, month, and year template files, added conditional to not
include ISS extended types (UV, radiation, ET) unless they exist.

Added an RSS feed.

Added support for PWSweather.com

Both WeatherUnderground and PWSweather posts are now retried up to 3 times
before giving up.

Now offer a section 'Extras' in the skin configuration file for including tags
added by the user. As an example, the tag radar_url has been moved into here.
 
Data files used in reports (such as weewx.css) are copied over to the HTML
directory on program startup.

Included an example of a low-battery alarm.

Rearranged distribution directory structure so that it matches the install
directory structure.

Moved base temperature for heating and cooling degree days into skin.conf.  They
now also require a unit.

Now require unit to be specified for 'altitude'.

1.5.0 03/07/10

Added support for other units besides the U.S. Customary. Plots and HTML reports
can be prepared using any arbitrary combination of units. For example, pressure
could be in millibars, while everything else is in U.S. Customary.

Because the configuration file weewx.conf changed significantly, the
installation script setup.py will NOT merge your old configuration file into the
new one. You will have to reedit weewx.conf to put in your customizations.

Added an exception handler for exception OSError, which is typically thrown when
another piece of software attempts to access the same device port.  Weewx
catches the exception, waits 10 seconds, then starts again from the top.

1.4.0 02/22/10

Changed the architecture of stats.py to one that uses very late binding. The SQL
statements are not run until template evaluation. This reduces the amount of
memory required (by about 1/2), reduces memory fragmentation, as well as greatly
simplifying the code (file stats.py shed over 150 lines of non-test code).
Execution time is slightly slower for NOAA file generation, slightly faster for
HTML file generation, the same for image generation, although your actual
results will depend on your disk speed.

Now possible to tell weewx to reread the configuration file without stopping
it. Send signal HUP to the process.

Added option week_start, for specifying which day a calendar week starts
on. Default is 6 (Sunday).

Fixed reporting bug when the reporting time falls on a calendar month or year
boundary.

1.3.4 02/08/10

Fixed problem when plotting data where all data points are bad (None).

1.3.3 01/10/10

Fixed reporting bug that shows itself if rain year does not start in January.

1.3.2 12/26/09

LOOP data added to stats database.

1.3.1 12/22/09

Added a call to syslog.openlog() that inadvertently got left out when switching
to the engine driven architecture.

1.3.0 12/21/09

Moved to a very different architecture to drive weewx. Consists of an engine,
that manages a list of 'services.' At key events, each service is given a chance
to participate. Services are easy to add, to allow easy customization. An
example is offered of an 'alarm' service.

Checking the clock of the weather station for drift is now a service, so the
option clock_check was moved from the station specific [VantagePro] section to
the more general [Station] section.

Added an example service 'MyAlarm', which sends out an email should the outside
temperature drop below 40 degrees.

In a similar manner, all generated files, images, and reports are the product of
a report engine, which can run any number of reports. New reports are easily
added.

Moved the compass rose used in progressive vector plots into the interior of the
plot.

Install now deletes public_html/#upstream.last, thus forcing all files to be
uploaded to the web server at the next opportunity.
 
1.2.0 11/22/09

Added progressive vector plots for wind data.

Improved axis scaling. The automatic axis scaling routine now does a better job
for ranges less than 1.0. The user can also hardwire in min and max values, as
well as specify a minimum increment, through parameter 'yscale' in section
[Images] in the configuration file.

Now allows the same SQL type to be used more than once in a plot. This allows,
say, instantaneous and average wind speed to be shown in the same plot.

Rain year is now parameterized in file templates/year.tmpl (instead of being
hardwired in).

Now does LOOP caching by default.

When doing backfilling to the stats database, configure now creates the stats
database if it doesn't already exist.

setup.py now more robust to upgrading the FTP and Wunderground sections


1.1.0 11/14/09

Added the ability to cache LOOP data. This can dramatically reduce the number of
writes to the stats database, reducing wear on solid-state disk stores.

Introduced module weewx.mainloop. Introduced class weewx.mainloop.MainLoop This
class offers many opportunities to customize weewx through subclassing, then
overriding an appropriate member function.

Refactored module weewx.wunderground so it more closely resembles the (better)
logic in wunderfixer.

setup.py no longer installs a daemon startup script to /etc/init.d. It must now
be done by hand.

setup.py now uses the 'home' value in setup.cfg to set WEEWX_ROOT in weewx.conf
and in the daemon start up scripts

Now uses FTP passive mode by default.

1.0.1 11/09/09

Fixed bug that prevented backfilling the stats database after modifying the main
archive.

1.0.0 10/26/09

Took the module weewx.factory back out, as it was too complicated and hard to
understand.

Added support for generating NOAA monthly and yearly reports. Completely rewrote
the filegenerator.py module, to allow easy subclassing and specialization.

Completely rewrote the stats.py module. All aggregate quantities are now
calculated dynamically.

Labels for HTML generation are now held separately from labels used for image
generation. This allows entities such as '&deg;' to be used for the former.

LOOP mode now requests only 200 LOOP records (instead of the old 2000). It then
renews the request should it run out. This was to get around an (undocumented)
limitation in the VP2 that limits the number of LOOP records that can be
requested to something like 220. This was a problem when supporting VP2s that
use long archive intervals.

Cut down the amount of computing that went on before the processing thread was
spawned, thus allowing the main thread to get back into LOOP mode more quickly.

Added type 'rainRate' to the types decoded from a Davis archive record. For some
reason it was left out.

Added retries when doing FTP uploads. It will now attempt the upload several
times before giving up.

Much more extensive DEBUG analysis.

Nipped and tucked here and there, trying to simplify.


0.6.5 10/11/09

Ported to Cheetah V2.2.X. Mostly, this is making sure that all strings that
cannot be converted with the 'ascii' codec are converted to Unicode first before
feeding to Cheetah.

0.6.4 9/22/09

Fixed an error in the calculation of heat index.

0.6.3 8/25/09

FTP transfers now default to ACTIVE mode, but a configuration file option allows
PASSIVE mode. This was necessary to support Microsoft FTP servers.

0.6.2 8/1/09

Exception handling in weewx/ftpdata.py used socket.error but failed to declare
it. Added 'import socket' to fix.

Added more complete check for unused pages in weewx/VantagePro.py. Now the
entire record must be filled with 0xff, not just the time field. This fixes a
bug where certain time stamps could look like unused records.

0.6.1 6/22/09

Fixed minor ftp bug.

0.6.0 5/20/09

Changed the file, imaging, ftping functions into objects, so they can be more
easily specialized by the user.

Introduced a StationData object.

Introduced module weewx.factory that produces these things, so the user has a
place to inject his/her new types.

0.5.1 5/13/09

1. Weather Underground thread now run as daemon thread, allowing the program to
exit even if it is running.

2. WU queue now hold an instance of archive and the time to be published, rather
than a record. This allows dailyrain to be published as well.

3. WU date is now given in the format "2009-05-13+12%3A35%3A00" rather than
"2009-05-13 12:35:00". Seems to be more reliable. But, maybe I'm imagining
things...
